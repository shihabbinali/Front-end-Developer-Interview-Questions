#### What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?

- Resetting: Remove all the native styles provided by browsers
- Normalizing: Make the browser styles consistent

#### Describe Floats and how they work.

There are `left`, `right` and `none` for `float`. Each value indicates how an
element should float. When `float` is set, each element will get out of its
normal flow and will be shifted to the specified direction, until it gets its
container or another floated element.

#### Describe z-index and how stacking context is formed.

`z-index` tells how elements should be stacked in a screen. Stacking context
can be formed in several situations, but most famously, by a root element and
positioned elements. In each stacking context, `z-index` will be calculated
separately for its children and will stack the children in ascending order.

#### Describe BFC(Block Formatting Context) and how it works.

BFC is a part of rendering a webpage. It's used to determine from which
positioning and clearing should be done. The context is created by several
ways, but the most famously, by a root element, float, positioned elements.

#### What are the various clearing techniques and which is appropriate for what context?

```css
clear:both;
```

```css
overflow: hidden;
height: auto;
```

#### Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.

CSS sprite is combining multiple images into a merged one image and use CSS to
render each of them properly for each element.

It's usually implemented using `background: url(...) x-axis y-axis;`, or
both `background-image` and `background-position`.

#### What are your favourite image replacement techniques and which do you use when?

Image replacement technique is to replace a normal text element with an image.
There are many methods such as H5BP and Scott Kellum, as suggested [here](https://css-tricks.com/the-image-replacement-museum/).

My faviourite is H5BP, as it is the simplest and most intuitive one.

- `@font-face` to write my own `font-family`
- `@import` to import prepared web font(e.g. Google Webfonts)

#### Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector.

- Reads right-to-left
  - Check matching elements for the key(right-most) selector
  - Check if the elements are matching parents for the next selectors

#### Describe pseudo-elements and discuss what they are used for.

It's to style a part of an element, like `::first-letter` or `::before`.

They can be used to add a special symbol before a paragraph, change color of

#### The 'C' in CSS stands for Cascading.  How is priority determined in assigning styles (a few examples)?  How can you use this system to your advantage?

CSS priority is determined by [specificity and inheritance](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/css-specificity-and-inheritance/).

- Specificity: ID > class, psuedo-class > element, psudo-element
- Inheritence: specified value → computed value → used value → actual value
